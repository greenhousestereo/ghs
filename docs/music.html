            <h6>Wilderness</h6>
            <p>You might ask yourself while sitting<br>
Alone in that quiet house<br>
Until the world just stops it's spinning<br>
And turning 'round on an empty shelf<br>
But the words have been coming forth<br>
Arguing so they've lost their voice<br>
And not a goddamn thing can be done<br>
<br><br>
The greats stole what's meaningless<br>
From the singing birds and cicada nests<br>
But it's just behavior calling out<br>
It'll never be what we think it was<br>
So I'm cleaning ink from my fingertips<br>
And I'm trying to be clear with this<br>
And I'm sticking my face out of<br>
A hole in the wilderness<br>
<br><br>
You know a person is what I think of them<br>
A whole white world of projections<br>
And I feel sorry for all my friends<br>
Who don't know quite what I've done to them<br>
And so everything belongs to me<br>
And I'll god damned if you think you'll see<br>
A day when I give back to the people<br>
I created when I stopped to think of them<br>
<br><br>
Excuses, they are made<br>
And they are tailor-fit for some audience<br>
But if sickness should be praised<br>
I shouldn't say what I think of them<br>
But I'm afraid I must admit<br>
Sometimes I miss the wilderness<br>
And I'm sticking my head back in<br>
If just to see why I, well I left it<br>
<br><br>
And I remember when we would walk<br>
Through the streets with our only friends<br>
With the cars just scattering by<br>
And the rocks we gripped in our coat pockets<br>
But the police, they stole our time<br>
And asked us to explain ourselves<br>
But we wouldn’t say a word, no, you had nothing<br>
To offer us</p>
