                      <h2>Wilderness</h2>
                      <p>
                        You might ask yourself while sitting<br>
                        Alone in that quiet house<br>
                        Until the world just stops it's spinning<br>
                        And turning 'round on an empty shelf<br>
                        But the words have been coming forth<br>
                        Arguing so they've lost their voice<br>
                        And not a goddamn thing can be done<br>
                        <br>
                        The greats stole what's meaningless<br>
                        From the singing birds and cicada nests<br>
                        But it's just behavior calling out<br>
                        It'll never be what we think it was<br>
                        So I'm cleaning ink from my fingertips<br>
                        And I'm trying to be clear with this<br>
                        And I'm sticking my face out of<br>
                        A hole in the wilderness<br>
                        <br>
                        You know a person is what I think of them<br>
                        A whole white world of projections<br>
                        And I feel sorry for all my friends<br>
                        Who don't know quite what I've done to them<br>
                        And so everything belongs to me<br>
                        And I'll god damned if you think you'll see<br>
                        A day when I give back to the people<br>
                        I created when I stopped to think of them<br>
                        <br>
                        Excuses, they are made<br>
                        And they are tailor-fit for some audience<br>
                        But if sickness should be praised<br>
                        I shouldn't say what I think of them<br>
                        But I'm afraid I must admit<br>
                        Sometimes I miss the wilderness<br>
                        And I'm sticking my head back in<br>
                        If just to see why I, well I left it<br>
                        <br>
                        And I remember when we would walk<br>
                        Through the streets with our only friends<br>
                        With the cars just scattering by<br>
                        And the rocks we gripped in our coat pockets<br>
                        But the police, they stole our time<br>
                        And asked us to explain ourselves<br>
                        But we wouldn’t say a word, no, you had nothing<br>
                        To offer us
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Oh, my poor friend did they<br>
                        take it away did they<br>
                        try to say that<br>
                        nothing changes when you<br>
                        take the trip and when you<br>
                        swallowed the pearl<br>
                        a suicide for a poor writer but your<br>
                        feet now on the world<br>
                        <br>
                        Oh, my poor friend did they<br>
                        lie and did they steal did they<br>
                        say such sweet things about<br>
                        what you'd feel but your<br>
                        mind has left you like a<br>
                        handful of sand and the<br>
                        dark world calls out for you to<br>
                        take its hand<br>
                        <br>
                        Oh, my poor friend did they<br>
                        send you to god did they<br>
                        bring you a higher message<br>
                        through the music you have lost<br>
                        and they swear you have it still<br>
                        but god damn them if they're right lost like a<br>
                        spark in the fire lost like a<br>
                        bird in the night<br>
                        <br>
                        Oh, my poor friend I'm afraid your<br>
                        number has been drawn<br>
                        I'm afraid of what you'll find when<br>
                        you're left all alone and I<br>
                        know it's too strange I know<br>
                        The beauty of it all<br>
                        Framed and placed in a bitter space<br>
                        Like those portraits on the walls<br>
                        <br>
                        Oh my poor friend it's getting<br>
                        harder to see in the<br>
                        shadows of your creations<br>
                        in your sins and your misdeeds<br>
                        Oh my poor friend when is it<br>
                        time to rest your head<br>
                        when is your single chance at peace again<br>
                        when is your cue to move ahead<br>
                        <br>
                        Oh, my poor friend you're getting<br>
                        sicker by the day<br>

                        When our temples come to life, we'll stop to watch the poor man die<br>
                        Frozen, stubborn, endless time has torn away the preacher's mind<br>
                        Pass on through your salts and gains--alive and well though thoughts displaced<br>
                        Never wonder for whom the bell rings. Wonder why it never rains<br>
                        <br>
                        I'll meet my friends at the edge of the earth, each man fed to obey the order<br>
                        We'll wait there till the world's a desert. Hold my, hand fall over the edge now<br>
                        Peace won't come, no peace won't last. Leaders too willing, will lead us so helpless<br>
                        And even though none of us ever knew our mothers, in the end, we all cry for them<br>
                        <br>
                        Tonight we face the blood in the sand. Our lives never rested in our hands<br>
                        They should find it no surprise that we're just fucking sick to die<br>
                        And my clover's peace will never be found, 'cause the hardest part of life is making a sound<br>
                        In this desolate existence, no one's ever gonna listen<br>

                      <p>
                        The World stopped spinning years ago in the spirit of barbed wire<br>
                        And sleepy eyes rest on the horizon<br>
                        And if you'd told me there's no future left for us right here<br>
                        I'd have said my poor friend just let it go, let it go<br>
                        So fill the world with love, kill the earth with time<br>
                        Don't tell me how it ends, just let it go, let it go<br>
                        And when we wake up in the morning we won't know where to go from here<br>
                        So let it go, let it go now<br>
                        <br>
                        Let it go, let it go now<br>
                        Let it go, let it go now<br>
                        Let it go, the world is fucked now<br>
                        <br>
                        And isn't that what we've been told, don't waste it all, don't live for more<br>
                        Choose to ignore our painted youth<br>
                        Someone's coming up the hill, without spirit and without will<br>
                        It's just another mind for me to abuse<br>
                        Industry, it's in our streets<br>
                        And isn't that what we've been told, don't waste it all, don't live for more<br>
                        Have you seen, blue moons rising<br>
                        Isn't that what we've been told, don't waste it all, don't live for more<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't waste it all, don't live for more<br>
                        Don't waste it all, don't live for more<br>
                        Don't waste it all don't live for more, no<br>
                        <br>
                        Promised rest, but go no sleep<br>
                        In this white-hot summer heat<br>
                        And street lights in parking lots<br>
                        Can't seem to stay on<br>
                        So lay with me for a little while<br>
                        Walk into the sun<br>
                        And we'll learn why the hills have been<br>
                        Indifferent towards us<br>
                        <br>
                        Meet me at the honeyed hotel<br>
                        Where the walls are bone and skull dry<br>
                        Where the rooms have cracked and bleached white<br>
                        Where you'll find me strange again<br>
                        <br>
                        It's where you'll find me strange again<br>
                        It's where you'll find me strange again<br>
                        <br>

                        So take the wind, rise and begin, follow it over<br>
                        In the Black Hills, the winter will, try to own you<br>
                        But I promise that, the water tracks, will overflow soon<br>
                        So take the wind, rise and begin, follow it over<br>
                        <br>
                        And did you know, that summer growth, is waiting for you<br>
                        To a special some, the time has come, to start the new year<br>
                        And nothing can, change the past, you've always been here<br>
                        And did you know, that summer growth, is waiting for you<br>

                        The medicine, causes bad dreams, but at least they're not real<br>
                        But then again, the same is said, about what you're hearing<br>
                        A voice is sent, from a cruel friend, your brain is bleeding<br>
                        The medicine, causes bad dreams, but at least they're not real<br>
                        <br>
                        You're a dancer that, is spinning fast, sick of the rhythm<br>
                        And the people's cheers, fall on deaf ears, and soon go quiet<br>
                        But you're moving now, can't be held down, by their silence<br>
                        You're a dancer that, is spinning fast, sick of the rhythm<br>
                        <br>
                        And nothing comes to you, anymore<br>

                        With just one drink from your ancient pearl<br>
                        And though we're sleeping now, still I'll wonder how, it got peaceful<br>
                        <br>
                        You said winter will bring you no luck<br>
                        It will drag you away from the high August sun<br>
                        But don't try to look around, for some higher ground, to hold onto<br>
                        <br>
                        Our dreams they transport us<br>
                        To a place where trains have ground to dust<br>
                        Cool air on ocean's green, and things I've never seen, but I want to<br>
                        <br>
                        And would it help you to be wide awake<br>
                        So that a lover's a stranger for the stranger's sake<br>
                        Can't tell them how to be, they aren't a part of me, and they've never been<br>

                        Our hands now they're starting to fold<br>
                        So we're running the facets until the water grows cold<br>
                        And searching for a way to make this new again<br>
                        And we're getting higher<br>
                        Getting higher<br>

                        Turn and face the ceiling. Search the patterns for new faces, it's a goddamn distraction<br>

                        The sky is glowing dark, and there's music in the spark<br>
                        It's all turning on you.<br>

                        <br>
                        God tricked the world with his colors<br>
                        Now you say you've left to go and find another<br>
                        Did you really think this world would change for you<br>
                        Did you really think this world would change for you<br>

                        And god is just a number on the wall<br>
                        And god is just a number on the wall<br>
                        <br>
                        The black birds all burn on their feeders<br>
                        Pull your fingers out my mouth they're tasting bitter<br>
                        And I don't think I can stand the sight of you<br>
                        No I don't think I can stand the sight of you<br>
                        <br>
                        And god is just as jealous as us all<br>
                        And god is just as jealous as us all<br>
                        <br>
                        We got stuck inside the attic; the music plays<br>
                        And you laid down in front of me to open your legs<br>
                        Can't stop staring at the spot where your clothes lay<br>

                        Such a sweet face welcome to the surface<br>
                        But we know you won't get any further<br>
                        So you sit and drink your cheap wine<br>
                        Don’t I know you're an expert<br>
                        <br>
                        Honeysuckle grows close to here<br>
                        But we know that’s not what you need<br>
                        You want the world to know who you are<br>
                        Why should you be so lucky<br>
                        <br>
                        And if you could choose would you choose right here<br>
                        Or would you still pull at your sleeves<br>
                        I think i'd like to have to just one thing<br>
                        Cause what’s the end of life but daylights peace<br>

                        <br>
                        And you know the world has stopped growing<br>
                        And there's less and less every day<br>
                        And I've been watching your faint eyes dull<br>
                        So I know you have your options weighed<br>
                        <br>
                        So I ask where you’re going <br>
                        And where you’ve been before here<br>
                        And would you like to see where I sleep<br>

                        <br>
                        And so we’re staring at the ceiling<br>
                        And we wonder how we get up there<br>
                        And though it's not far up there<br>
                        It’s at least so far from here<br>

                        The time has come to choose a new sun<br>
                        Sit beneath it, and whisper<br>
                        We're hanging up blankets on the walls<br>
                        You still stand by the window<br>
                        And I know I can do nothing at all about the way that you see me<br>
                        But I can't stop having these medication dreams so next time<br>
                        Please leave me to sleep<br>
                        <br>
                        Your world got trapped inside a dandelion seed<br>
                        The way it drifts from here to there<br>
                        And I know I can do nothing at all to stop it on its way<br>
                        Something is ringing clear<br>
                        So pick your head up off of my lap, it's time to leave<br>
                        I found a new way to set you free<br>
                        Because sometimes life is impossible to orchestrate<br>
                        Sometimes you've just gotta flee<br>

                      <p>
                        She said I came from nowhere<br>
                        And that nowhere was close to home<br>
                        So I found a house with red ceilings<br>
                        And dark green furniture<br>
                        Where smoke, it rose from cinders<br>
                        In lavish incense holds<br>
                        Where I hoped I had a soul<br>
                        <br>
                        She said I don’t want to lose you<br>
                        When it starts to snow<br>
                        And that true monsters are waiting<br>
                        For the winter months<br>
                        But the season, it will follow me<br>
                        It has no place to go<br>
                        I can feel it in my bones<br>
                        <br>
                        The Hills have stayed indifferent<br>
                        And I freely come and go<br>
                        But each time the day is shorter<br>
                        The blue water stops its pour<br>
                        And builds up in a barrier<br>
                        And refuses to move much more<br>
                        But maybe with enough force<br>
                        <br>
                        I guess I have no interest<br>
                        In empty Honeyed Hotels<br>
                        Where the walls have yellowed with the sun<br>
                        And the world spins on a shelf<br>
                        And the ravaged dogs, with their orange eyes<br>
                        Nothing left to tell<br>
                        My friends know this all too well<br>
                        <br>
                        So I hope to find that bleeding house<br>
                        In the valley where it sits<br>
                        Because I know that there is comfort there<br>
                        Although it has its risks<br>
                        And the water will be free once more<br>
                        When the Hills release their grip<br>
                        And all that I leave behind is this<br>

                      <h2>A Penny Saved</h2>
                      <p>
                        A penny saved is a woman fired<br>
                        ‘Cause at work, all they do is cry<br>
                        And bitch and moan about equality<br>
                        Until you find them talking and gossiping<br>
                        In the backroom where no one’s supposed to go<br>
                        <br>
                        Separate the sports and separate the games<br>
                        They need a handicap in everything we play<br>
                        Soccer and football, mother fucking gym<br>
                        Nothing’s equal playing fair with them<br>
                        You’ll soon find them asking for an exception<br>
                        <br>
                        Police stations and the army, too<br>
                        Do you feel safe with them protecting you<br>
                        ‘Cause under pressure, all women crack<br>
                        Yet they tag along in the war in Iraq<br>
                        No man should die for a woman’s mistake<br>
                        <br>
                        Having kids their specialty<br>
                        But raise them alone, and you’ll soon see<br>
                        Not all their kids fill our prisons<br>
                        But seventy percent, well, it’s a shocking figure<br>
                        Single mothers, responsible for crooks<br>
                        <br>
                        Working and thinking, it’s what men do<br>
                        So what’s left for a woman to do<br>
                        But cook and clean, wash the glass<br>
                        Or sit at home on their ass<br>
                        And still they’ll bitch about how hard it can be<br>
                        <br>
                        This is the truth, although it may sound harsh<br>
                        Pregnancy, it’s always their fault<br>
                        When everything’s fine, they’ll take responsibility<br>
                        And they have no problem laying claims to their bodies<br>
                        But when the bills stack up, they’re willing to sell some stock<br>
                        <br>
                        It’s a metaphor<br>
                        It means they’re whores<br>

                      <p>
                        I've gone far above my call to sin<br>
                        Been sitting languid tired and content<br>
                        My voice has gotten thin<br>
                        Cause you gotta be loud if you wanna blend in<br>
                        <br>
                        I've got a pistol sitting on my brain<br>
                        Unload reload and clean it out again<br>
                        I'll go visit friends<br>
                        Just so I can feel alive again<br>
                        <br>
                        I've been drinking down the bath for days<br>
                        Gonna hang the picture once I find the frame<br>
                        Just want to be awake<br>
                        Cause sleep isn't easy when everyone knows that you're fake<br>
                        <br>
                        You can't walk backwards, but you can loop around<br>
                        The hand keeps moving, and it just won't slow down<br>
                        They only love you later on<br>
                        But for now you'll have to pretend that you're wrong<br>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        You thought you knew your features well<br>
                        You thought you knew every inch of yourself<br>
                        Until you saw your face, that glass image, and you remembered yourself once again<br>
                        A soundless home, a distance grown, an understanding that you're wrong<br>
                        And you feel it, well sure you do<br>
                        <br>
                        You tried to call that number then<br>
                        You lost your chance with the smear of a pen<br>
                        So your thoughts have strayed, your colors fade, and weakness is forever made<br>
                        The time has gone, you've left your home, now you're standing in some madman's clothes<br>
                        And you feel it, well sure you do<br>
                        <br>
                        And he said<br>
                        You will pay for everything you've done<br>
                        You will pay no matter where you go<br>
                        And now you find, sickness in crime, you've lost your only sense of time<br>
                        A twisted tongue, it’s a restless song, the forest aches for every dawn<br>
                        And you feel it, please say you do<br>
                        <br>
                        He said I am now alive again, again<br>
                        He said I will never be your friend, your friend<br>
                        He said I am that on which you depend, depend<br>
                        He said I will be duplicity foreign<br>
                        He said I will be duplicity foreign<br>
                        He said I will be duplicity foreign<br>

                        Voice in the mirror it was nothing new<br>

                        Don't you know some things shouldn't exist<br>
                        Mosquitoes in the air, not a lick of difference<br>
                        Always in the reach of your sipless poison<br>
                        All I want now is a stop of events<br>
